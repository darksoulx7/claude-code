Project Memory with CLAUDE.md\n\nWhat it does: Automatically loaded instructions that Claude reads every time you start a session in that project.\n\nFile locations (priority order):\n1. Current directory: ./CLAUDE.md\n2. Parent directories: ../CLAUDE.md, ../../CLAUDE.md \n3. Global user file: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md\n\nEssential CLAUDE.md template:\nProject: E-commerce Platform\n\nTech Stack\n- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind\n- Backend: Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL\n- Auth: NextAuth.js + JWT\n\nCode Standards\n- Always use TypeScript strict mode\n- Prefer functional components with hooks\n- Use Zod for all validation\n- Follow conventional commit format\n\nTesting Requirements\n- Write tests for all new features\n- Maintain 80%+ coverage\n- Use Jest + Testing Library\n\nCommands\n- npm run dev - Start development server\n- npm run test - Run test suite\n- npm run build - Production build\n\nArchitecture Decisions\n- Use tRPC for type-safe APIs\n- Implement optimistic updates for better UX\n- Store user preferences in localStorage\n\nRecent Context\n- Currently migrating from REST to GraphQL\n- Working on real-time notifications with WebSockets\n\nDynamic updates:\nClaude can update CLAUDE.md based on decisions\n> \"We decided to use Redis for caching. Update our project guidelines.\"\nClaude adds Redis info to CLAUDE.md automatically\n\n2. File Context with @\n\nWhat it does: Include files and directories in conversation context without manual copy-pasting.\n\nFile reference patterns:\nSingle files\n@package.json          Include package.json content\n@src/components/Button.tsx  Specific component file\n\nMultiple files  \n@src/utils/ @src/types/  Include entire directories\n\nMixed references\n@README.md @src/App.tsx @tests/  Files and directories together\n\nStrategic context loading:\nUnderstanding a feature\n@src/components/UserProfile.tsx @src/hooks/useUser.ts @src/types/user.ts\n> \"Explain how user profile data flows through this system\"\n\nDebugging across multiple files\n@src/auth/ @src/middleware/ @src/routes/auth.ts\n> \"There's a bug in the authentication flow. Analyze these files and fix it.\"\n\nRefactoring with full context\n@src/legacy/ @src/new-architecture/\n> \"Migrate the legacy authentication system to the new architecture\"\n\n3. Multi-Project Context with /dir\n\nWhat it does: Add context from different projects to your current conversation.\n\nUsage patterns:\nAdd another project's context\n/dir /path/to/other-project\n\nCompare implementations across projects\n/dir ../legacy-app\n> \"Compare the authentication implementation in this project vs the legacy app\"\n\nReference patterns from other codebases\n/dir ~/projects/reference-implementation  \n> \"Apply the same architectural patterns we used in the reference project\"\n\nPowerful workflows:\n\nCross-project refactoring:\nCurrent project: new-api\nReference project: proven-api-design\n/dir ../proven-api-design\n> \"Refactor our API to follow the same patterns as the proven design, but adapted for our domain\"\n\nLearning from previous work:\n/dir ~/projects/successful-ecommerce\n> \"We're building a new checkout flow. Analyze the successful patterns from the ecommerce project and implement similar solutions\"\n\nMigration assistance:\n/dir ../old-system\n> \"Help me migrate the user management functionality from the old system to our new architecture\"\n\nTeam knowledge sharing:\n/dir ../teammate-project\n> \"Study how authentication is implemented in the teammate's project and suggest improvements for our approach\"\n\nESSENTIAL NAVIGATION & MANAGEMENT\n\n4. Navigate Conversation History with Esc + Esc\n\nWhat it does: Quickly jump back to any previous point in your conversation without scrolling.\n\nHow to use:\n1. Press Esc twice during any Claude session\n2. Navigate through a list of conversation checkpoints\n3. Select any previous message to resume from that point\n\nWhy it's powerful:\n- Jump back to successful implementations\n- Recover from mistakes without losing context\n- Review Claude's reasoning at different stages\n\nExample scenario:\nYou're debugging a complex feature\n> \"Debug this authentication issue\"\nClaude provides solution A\n> \"Actually, try a different approach\"\nClaude provides solution B (doesn't work)\nPress Esc + Esc → Jump back to solution A → Continue from there\n\n5. Context Management with /clear and /compact\n\nWhat it does: Manage conversation context to prevent token bloat and maintain focus.\n\n/clear - Fresh Start:\nUse when switching to unrelated tasks\n> \"Build authentication system\"\nWork on auth for 30 minutes...\n/clear\n> \"Now create a data visualization dashboard\"\nFresh context, no auth details cluttering the conversation\n\n/compact - Intelligent Summarization:\nUse when context is relevant but conversation is long\n> \"Refactor the entire user management system\"\nLong conversation with multiple iterations...\n/compact\nClaude summarizes key decisions and current state\n> \"Now add admin permissions to this system\"\nContinues with compressed context\n\nWhen to use each:\n/clear: Switching projects, unrelated tasks, after major milestones\n/compact: Long sessions, context getting full, but need to maintain continuity\n\nPro monitoring:\n- Watch the context indicator (bottom-right)\n- Clear proactively at natural breakpoints\n- Compact when approaching context limits\n\n6. Resume Conversations with claude --resume\n\nWhat it does: Continue exactly where you left off in your previous Claude session.\n\nUsage patterns:\nResume most recent conversation\nclaude --resume\n\nResume specific conversation (if multiple)\nclaude --resume --select\nShows list of recent conversations to choose from\n\nResume in non-interactive mode\nclaude --resume --print\nContinues previous conversation in headless mode\n\nWhat's preserved:\n- Complete message history\n- Context from previous session\n- Tool usage and results\n- Project state and memory\n\nExample workflow:\nDay 1: Start complex refactoring\n> \"Refactor the entire authentication system to use OAuth2\"\nWork for 2 hours, then close terminal\n\nDay 2: Resume exactly where you left off\nclaude --resume\nAll previous context is restored\n> \"Continue with the OAuth2 implementation where we left off\"\n\nCORE WORKFLOW FEATURES\n\n7. Instant Memory Addition with #\n\nWhat it does: Quickly add context or preferences to your project memory without manual file editing.\n\nHow to use:\n> \"Create a login form # always use Zod for validation\"\n> \"Build the dashboard # prefer MUI components over custom CSS\"\n> \"Add error handling # use our standard error boundary pattern\"\n\nWhat happens: Claude automatically saves these preferences to the most relevant memory file (CLAUDE.md, project memory, or user memory) and applies them to future tasks.\n\nExample workflow:\n> \"Style this button # our brand uses #3B82F6 as primary blue\"\nClaude saves this color preference and uses it in all future styling tasks\n\n8. Queue Commands While Claude Works\n\nWhat it does: Add multiple tasks to a queue while Claude is actively processing your current request.\n\nHow to use:\n> \"Refactor the user authentication system\"\nWhile Claude is working, you can add:\n> \"Also add comprehensive unit tests\"\n> \"And update the documentation\"\n> \"Plus add TypeScript types everywhere\"\n\nSmart behavior: Claude intelligently batches these commands and executes them when appropriate, asking for feedback only when necessary.\n\nExample workflow:\n> \"Build a shopping cart component\"\nQueue while processing:\n> \"Add cart persistence to localStorage\"\n> \"Include quantity controls\"\n> \"Add price calculations\"\n> \"Style it with Tailwind\"\nClaude will handle all these systematically\n\n9. Commit Workflow as Checkpoints\n\nWhat it does: Use git commits as natural checkpoints in your development workflow.\n\nBest practice pattern:\nComplete a logical unit of work\n> \"Implement user login functionality with validation\"\n\nAlways commit when task is complete\n> \"Commit these changes with a descriptive message\"\n\nThis creates a checkpoint you can return to\n> \"Now add password reset functionality\"\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n> \"Revert to the last commit and try a different approach\"\n\nAdvanced checkpoint strategy:\n1. Feature branch for experimentation\n> \"Create a feature branch called 'experiment-auth-refactor'\"\n\n2. Small, frequent commits\n> \"Commit after each small change so we can rollback easily\"\n\n3. Use commits for A/B testing approaches  \n> \"Try approach A, commit it, then try approach B in next commit\"\n\nMODEL & PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION\n\n10. Switch Models with /model\n\nWhat it does: Change Claude models mid-conversation based on task complexity.\n\nUsage patterns:\nQuick switch to specific model\n/model haiku     Fast, cheap for simple tasks\n/model sonnet    Balanced for daily development  \n/model opus      Powerful for complex architecture\n\nOr just /model to see available options and switch interactively\n\nStrategic model usage:\nStart with Sonnet for feature development\n> \"Build user dashboard with charts\"\n\nSwitch to Opus for complex refactoring\n/model opus\n> \"Refactor this entire authentication system to use OAuth2\"\n\nSwitch to Haiku for quick fixes\n/model haiku  \n> \"Fix indentation and add missing semicolons\"\n\nCost optimization:\nHaiku: $0.25/MTok - Use for formatting, simple fixes\nSonnet: $3/MTok - Daily development workhorse\nOpus: $15/MTok - Complex architecture, code reviews\n\n11. Extended Thinking with Think Keywords\n\nWhat it does: Activate Claude's extended reasoning mode for complex problems.\n\nKeywords that trigger extended thinking:\n> \"think hard about the best architecture for this microservices system\"\n> \"think deeply about security implications of this API design\"  \n> \"ultrathink the performance bottlenecks in this database schema\"\n> \"think harder about edge cases in this authentication flow\"\n\nWhen extended thinking appears:\n- Complex architectural decisions\n- Security analysis\n- Performance optimization\n- Edge case identification\n- Multi-step problem solving\n\nExample usage:\n> \"think hard about migrating our monolith to microservices\"\n\nClaude shows extended thinking:\n\"Let me think through this systematically...\n1. Current coupling between components\n2. Data consistency requirements  \n3. Network latency implications\n4. Deployment complexity...\"\n\nThen provides comprehensive analysis\n\nADVANCED FEATURES\n\n12. Control Automation with Settings\n\nWhat it does: Configure Claude's behavior for plan mode and auto-accept edit mode.\n\nConfiguration file: .claude/settings.json\n{\n  \"planMode\": true,\n  \"autoAcceptEdits\": false,\n  \"defaultModel\": \"sonnet\",\n  \"permissionDefaults\": {\n    \"read\": true,\n    \"write\": \"ask\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlan Mode: Claude creates a detailed plan before executing\nWith plan mode enabled:\n> \"Build a REST API for user management\"\nClaude shows: \"Here's my plan: 1. Create routes 2. Add validation 3. Implement auth...\"\nYou approve, then Claude executes the plan step by step\n\nAuto-Accept Edit Mode: Automatically approve file changes\nDangerous but fast - Claude edits files without asking\nGood for: Formatting, linting fixes, batch updates\nBad for: Complex logic changes, new features\n\n13. Direct Image Pasting with Ctrl+V\n\nWhat it does: Paste images directly into Claude terminal for visual development.\n\nKey difference: Use Ctrl+V (not Cmd+V on Mac)\n\nWorkflow examples:\nDesign implementation\n1. Take screenshot of design mockup\n2. Ctrl+V in Claude terminal\n> \"Implement this design in React with Tailwind CSS\"\n\nBug reporting with visuals  \n1. Screenshot of broken UI\n2. Ctrl+V in Claude\n> \"This button styling is broken on mobile. Fix the responsive design.\"\n\nVisual iteration\n> \"Take a screenshot of the current implementation\"\nClaude uses Puppeteer MCP to screenshot\n> \"Compare with the original design and fix differences\"\n\nPro tip: Use Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4 on Mac to screenshot directly to clipboard, then Ctrl+V to paste.\n\n14. Custom Commands with /command\n\nWhat it does: Create reusable command templates for common workflows.\n\nCreating custom commands:\nCreate commands directory\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\n\nCreate custom command file\nFile: .claude/commands/deploy.md\n\nExample custom commands:\n\nFile: .claude/commands/deploy.md\nDeploy application following our checklist:\n1. Run full test suite and ensure all tests pass\n2. Update version in package.json\n3. Generate production build\n4. Run security audit on dependencies  \n5. Deploy to staging environment\n6. Run smoke tests on staging\n7. Deploy to production if staging tests pass\n8. Update deployment documentation\n9. Notify team in Slack #deployments channel\n\nFile: .claude/commands/feature.md\nImplement new feature: $ARGUMENTS\n\nFollow our standard process:\n1. Create feature branch: feature/$ARGUMENTS\n2. Write failing tests first (TDD approach)\n3. Implement minimal code to pass tests\n4. Add comprehensive error handling\n5. Update documentation and examples\n6. Ensure accessibility compliance\n7. Create PR with proper template\n8. Add entry to CHANGELOG.md\n\nUsage:\n/deploy                    Run deployment checklist\n/feature user-dashboard    Implement user dashboard feature\n\nINTEGRATION & AUTOMATION\n\n15. IDE Integration with /ide\n\nWhat it does: Connect Claude to your VS Code for seamless integration.\n\nSetup and usage:\nConnect to current VS Code instance\n/ide\n\nOpens Claude panel in VS Code sidebar\nNow you can:\n- Reference files from file explorer\n- Apply changes directly to open files\n- See diffs before accepting changes\n- Use Claude while keeping your normal editing flow\n\nWorkflow benefits:\nIn VS Code terminal:\nclaude\n> \"Refactor this component to use hooks\"\n\nChanges appear in VS Code diff view\nAccept/reject each change individually\nKeep your normal editing workflow\n\nAlternative: VS Code Extension\n- Install Claude Code extension from marketplace\n- Launch Claude instances from command palette\n- Multiple Claude sessions in different panes\n\n16. Headless Mode with claude -p\n\nWhat it does: Run Claude commands without interactive interface - perfect for automation.\n\nBasic usage:\nSingle command execution\nclaude -p \"Fix all ESLint errors in the project\"\n\nWith JSON output for automation\nclaude -p \"Analyze this codebase for security vulnerabilities\" --output-format json\n\nPipe integration  \ngit log --oneline | claude -p \"Summarize recent changes and suggest release notes\"\n\nAutomation examples:\n\nPre-commit hook:\n#!/bin/bash\n# .git/hooks/pre-commit\nclaude -p \"Quick security scan of staged files. Report only critical issues.\" --json\n\nCI/CD integration:\nGitHub Actions\n- name: Code Review\n  run: claude -p \"Review changed files for bugs and security issues\" --json\n\nMonitoring automation:\nMonitor logs for issues\ntail -f app.log | claude -p \"Alert me if error patterns emerge\" \n\nAutomated documentation updates\nclaude -p \"Update API documentation based on recent code changes\"\n\nAdvanced piping:\nChain with other tools\ncat error.log | claude -p \"Analyze errors and suggest fixes\" | jq '.suggestions[]'\n\nBatch processing\nfind . -name \"*.js\" | claude -p \"Security audit these JavaScript files\"\n\nADVANCED AGENT ORCHESTRATION\n\n17. Sub Agents\n\nWhat it does: Claude can spawn specialized sub-agents to handle specific subtasks while maintaining the main conversation flow.\n\nHow it works:\nClaude automatically creates sub-agents when tasks require specialized focus or parallel processing. You'll see indicators like \"Task(Research authentication patterns)...\" in the output.\n\nManual sub-agent creation:\n> \"Use subagents to research OAuth2 best practices while I continue working on the UI\"\n> \"Spawn a subagent to analyze our current security posture\"\n> \"Create a specialized subagent for database optimization tasks\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Parallel processing of complex tasks\n- Specialized expertise for different domains\n- Context isolation for focused work\n- Maintains main conversation flow\n\nExample workflow:\n> \"Build a complete e-commerce system\"\nClaude creates subagents:\n- Task(Research payment gateway integration)\n- Task(Design database schema)\n- Task(Plan frontend architecture)\n- Task(Security requirements analysis)\n\nEach subagent works independently while reporting back to main Claude instance.\n\n18. Sub Agent Chaining\n\nWhat it does: Create chains of sub-agents where the output of one becomes input for the next, creating sophisticated workflows.\n\nHow to use:\n> \"Create a subagent chain: 1) Research competitor APIs, 2) Design our API based on findings, 3) Generate implementation plan, 4) Create code structure\"\n\nAdvanced chaining example:\n> \"Chain subagents for user authentication: Research → Design → Implement → Test → Document\"\n\nEach agent in the chain:\n1. Agent 1: Research authentication methods and security best practices\n2. Agent 2: Design authentication flow based on research\n3. Agent 3: Implement the authentication system\n4. Agent 4: Create comprehensive tests\n5. Agent 5: Generate documentation\n\nSequential execution:\n> \"Create a deployment chain: code review → security scan → build → test → staging deploy → production deploy\"\n\nConditional chaining:\n> \"Chain subagents but only proceed to next step if previous succeeds: lint → test → build → deploy\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Complex workflows broken into manageable steps\n- Quality gates between stages\n- Rollback capability at each stage\n- Parallel branches when needed\n\n19. Background Bash Agents\n\nWhat it does: Run specialized agents that monitor system processes, logs, or perform continuous tasks in the background while you work on other things.\n\nSetting up background agents:\n> \"Start a background agent to monitor our application logs and alert me about errors\"\n> \"Run a background bash agent to watch file changes and auto-restart the server\"\n> \"Create a monitoring agent that tracks system performance during our load test\"\n\nBackground monitoring examples:\nLog monitoring agent:\n> \"Background agent: tail -f /var/log/app.log and notify me of any ERROR or CRITICAL level messages\"\n\nPerformance monitoring agent:\n> \"Start background monitoring of CPU and memory usage during this deployment\"\n\nSecurity monitoring agent:\n> \"Background agent: monitor failed login attempts and alert if threshold exceeded\"\n\nDevelopment workflow agents:\nAuto-testing agent:\n> \"Background agent: watch src/ directory and run relevant tests when files change\"\n\nCode quality agent:\n> \"Background agent: run ESLint on any modified files and report issues\"\n\nDeployment monitoring agent:\n> \"Background agent: monitor staging environment health during deployment\"\n\nManaging background agents:\n> \"List all active background agents\"\n> \"Stop the log monitoring agent\"\n> \"Show output from performance monitoring agent\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Continuous monitoring without manual oversight\n- Early detection of issues\n- Automated quality checks\n- Hands-free operational tasks\n\n20. Parallel Agents\n\nWhat it does: Run multiple Claude instances simultaneously, each working on different aspects of the same project or different projects entirely.\n\nSetting up parallel agents:\nTerminal approach:\n# Terminal 1\nclaude\n> \"Work on frontend user interface\"\n\n# Terminal 2  \nclaude\n> \"Develop backend API endpoints\"\n\n# Terminal 3\nclaude\n> \"Create comprehensive test suite\"\n\n# Terminal 4\nclaude\n> \"Handle DevOps and deployment setup\"\n\nCoordinated parallel work:\n> \"Start parallel agents: one for React frontend, one for Node.js backend, one for database design, one for testing\"\n\nGit worktree parallel development:\n> \"Create git worktrees for parallel development: main feature in worktree1, experimental approach in worktree2\"\n\nAdvanced parallel patterns:\nA/B testing parallel agents:\n> \"Run two parallel agents: one implementing approach A, another implementing approach B for the same feature\"\n\nCompetitive development:\n> \"Start parallel agents working on the same problem with different approaches, then compare results\"\n\nSpecialized team simulation:\n> \"Parallel agents: Frontend specialist, Backend specialist, DevOps specialist, QA specialist - simulate a full development team\"\n\nCross-project parallel work:\n# Project 1\nclaude\n> \"Refactor authentication system\"\n\n# Project 2\nclaude  \n> \"Build new user dashboard\"\n\n# Project 3\nclaude\n> \"Optimize database queries\"\n\nCoordination strategies:\nShared context updates:\n> \"Update all parallel agents with this new requirement: implement GDPR compliance\"\n\nProgress synchronization:\n> \"Check progress of all parallel agents and create unified status report\"\n\nIntegration planning:\n> \"Coordinate parallel agents to merge their work at the next milestone\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Massive productivity multiplication\n- Different approaches to same problem\n- Parallel exploration of alternatives\n- Simulated team development\n- Faster iteration cycles\n\nPOWER USER MASTER WORKFLOW\n\nComplete Advanced Workflow:\n1. Setup project foundation\nclaude\n@CLAUDE.md @package.json @src/\n/dir ../reference-project\n\n2. Configure for optimal performance\n/model opus\n> \"think hard about the architecture for this complex system\"\n\n3. Start parallel development\n> \"Create parallel agents: frontend team, backend team, testing team, devops team\"\n\n4. Setup background monitoring\n> \"Start background agents for log monitoring, performance tracking, and security scanning\"\n\n5. Use subagent chains for complex features\n> \"Create subagent chain for user authentication: research → design → implement → test → document\"\n\n6. Queue coordinated tasks\n> \"Coordinate all agents to implement OAuth2 integration\"\n> \"All agents should follow our security standards # use industry best practices\"\n> \"Update progress every 30 minutes # checkpoint pattern\"\n\n7. Manage context and checkpoints\n/compact when needed\n> \"Commit each agent's work as separate feature branches\"\n\n8. Deploy with automation\n/deploy\n> \"Coordinate deployment across all parallel workstreams\"\n\n9. Monitor and iterate\n> \"Background agents continue monitoring while we iterate on next features\"\n\nThis advanced orchestration turns Claude Code into a complete development team, handling multiple aspects of software development simultaneously while maintaining coordination and quality standards. i have this info rephrase this without chaging anything into text file which content i will directly paste into word file but use simple words and follow proper format structure and spacing and do not hallicunate and give me file like claude_features.txt file."},"uuid":"da65fa4c-712a-4a2c-b99e-c837392bf12b","timestamp":"2025-08-12T13:18:17.294Z"}

INSTANT MEMORY ADDITION WITH #\n\nWhat it does:\nQuickly add context or preferences to your project memory without editing files manually.\n\nHow to use:\nAsk: \"Create a login form # always use Zod for validation\"\nAsk: \"Build the dashboard # prefer MUI components over custom CSS\"\nAsk: \"Add error handling # use our standard error boundary pattern\"\n\nWhat happens: Claude automatically saves these preferences to the right memory file (CLAUDE.md, project memory, or user memory) and uses them in future tasks.\n\nExample workflow:\nAsk: \"Style this button # our brand uses #3B82F6 as primary blue\"\nClaude saves this color preference and uses it in all future styling tasks\n\n\n8. QUEUE COMMANDS WHILE CLAUDE WORKS\n\nWhat it does:\nAdd multiple tasks to a waiting list while Claude is actively working on your current request.\n\nHow to use:\nAsk: \"Redesign the user login system\"\nWhile Claude is working, you can add:\nAsk: \"Also add comprehensive unit tests\"\nAsk: \"And update the documentation\"\nAsk: \"Plus add TypeScript types everywhere\"\n\nSmart behavior: Claude intelligently groups these commands and runs them when appropriate, asking for feedback only when necessary.\n\nExample workflow:\nAsk: \"Build a shopping cart component\"\nQueue while processing:\nAsk: \"Add cart saving to localStorage\"\nAsk: \"Include quantity controls\"\nAsk: \"Add price calculations\"\nAsk: \"Style it with Tailwind\"\nClaude will handle all these systematically\n\n\n9. COMMIT WORKFLOW AS CHECKPOINTS\n\nWhat it does:\nUse git commits as natural save points in your development workflow.\n\nBest practice pattern:\nComplete a logical unit of work:\nAsk: \"Add user login functionality with validation\"\n\nAlways commit when task is complete:\nAsk: \"Commit these changes with a descriptive message\"\n\nThis creates a save point you can return to:\nAsk: \"Now add password reset functionality\"\n\nIf something goes wrong:\nAsk: \"Go back to the last commit and try a different approach\"\n\nAdvanced save point strategy:\n1. Feature branch for experiments\nAsk: \"Create a feature branch called 'experiment-auth-redesign'\"\n\n2. Small, frequent commits\nAsk: \"Commit after each small change so we can rollback easily\"\n\n3. Use commits for testing different approaches  \nAsk: \"Try approach A, commit it, then try approach B in next commit\"\n\n\n================================================================================\nMODEL AND PERFORMANCE FEATURES\n================================================================================\n\n10.

PROJECT MEMORY WITH CLAUDE.md\n\nWhat it does:\nClaude automatically reads instructions from a CLAUDE.md file every time you start working on a project.\n\nFile locations (checked in this order):\n1. Current folder: ./CLAUDE.md\n2. Parent folders: ../CLAUDE.md, ../../CLAUDE.md \n3. User home folder: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md\n\nSample CLAUDE.md file:\n--------------------------------------------------\nProject: Online Store Platform\n\nTechnology Stack:\n- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind\n- Backend: Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL\n- Login System: NextAuth.js + JWT\n\nCoding Rules:\n- Always use TypeScript strict mode\n- Use functional components with hooks\n- Use Zod for input validation\n- Follow standard commit message format\n\nTesting Rules:\n- Write tests for all new features\n- Keep test coverage above 80%\n- Use Jest + Testing Library\n\nCommands:\n- npm run dev - Start development server\n- npm run test - Run all tests\n- npm run build - Build for production\n\nDesign Decisions:\n- Use tRPC for type-safe APIs\n- Use optimistic updates for better user experience\n- Store user settings in localStorage\n\nCurrent Work:\n- Moving from REST API to GraphQL\n- Adding real-time notifications with WebSockets\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic updates:\nClaude can update CLAUDE.md automatically when you make decisions.\nExample: \"We decided to use Redis for caching. Update our project guidelines.\"\nClaude will add Redis information to CLAUDE.md automatically.\n\n\n2. FILE CONTEXT WITH @\n\nWhat it does:\nInclude files and folders in your conversation without copying and pasting.\n\nWays to reference files:\nSingle files:\n@package.json                    Include package.json content\n@src/components/Button.tsx       Include specific component file\n\nMultiple files:\n@src/utils/ @src/types/          Include entire folders\n\nMixed references:\n@README.md @src/App.tsx @tests/  Include files and folders together\n\nSmart ways to use this:\nUnderstanding how something works:\n@src/components/UserProfile.tsx @src/hooks/useUser.ts @src/types/user.ts\nThen ask: \"Explain how user profile data works in this system\"\n\nFinding and fixing bugs:\n@src/auth/ @src/middleware/ @src/routes/auth.ts\nThen ask: \"There's a bug in the login system. Look at these files and fix it.\"\n\nChanging code structure:\n@src/legacy/ @src/new-architecture/\nThen ask: \"Move the old login system to the new structure\"\n\n\n3. MULTI-PROJECT CONTEXT WITH /dir\n\nWhat it does:\nAdd files and context from other projects to your current conversation.\n\nBasic usage:\n/dir /path/to/other-project\n\nCompare different projects:\n/dir ../old-app\nThen ask: \"Compare the login system in this project vs the old app\"\n\nLearn from other projects:\n/dir ~/projects/reference-project\nThen ask: \"Use the same patterns we used in the reference project\"\n\nReal examples:\n\nMoving code between projects:\nCurrent project: new-api\nReference project: working-api-design\n/dir ../working-api-design\nThen ask: \"Change our API to work like the proven design, but for our specific needs\"\n\nLearning from past work:\n/dir ~/projects/successful-shop\nThen ask: \"We're building a new checkout system. Look at the successful patterns from the shop project and use similar ideas\"\n\nGetting help with migration:\n/dir ../old-system\nThen ask: \"Help me move the user management features from the old system to our new setup\"\n\nLearning from teammates:\n/dir ../teammate-project\nThen ask: \"Study how login works in the teammate's project and suggest improvements for our approach\"\n\n\n================================================================================\nNAVIGATION AND MANAGEMENT\n================================================================================\n\n4. NAVIGATE CONVERSATION HISTORY WITH ESC + ESC\n\nWhat it does:\nQuickly jump back to any earlier point in your conversation without scrolling.\n\nHow to use:\n1. Press Esc twice during any Claude session\n2. See a list of conversation points\n3. Click any previous message to go back to that point\n\nWhy this is useful:\n- Go back to working solutions\n- Fix mistakes without losing your work\n- Review Claude's thinking at different stages\n\nExample situation:\nYou're fixing a complex bug\nAsk: \"Fix this login issue\"\nClaude gives solution A\nAsk: \"Actually, try a different way\"\nClaude gives solution B (doesn't work)\nPress Esc + Esc → Go back to solution A → Continue from there\n\n\n5. MANAGE CONTEXT WITH /clear AND /compact\n\nWhat it does:\nControl conversation memory to prevent slowdowns and stay focused.\n\n/clear - Start Fresh:\nUse when switching to completely different tasks\nExample: \"Build login system\"\nWork on login for 30 minutes...\n/clear\nAsk: \"Now create a data charts dashboard\"\nFresh start, no login details cluttering the conversation\n\n/compact - Smart Summary:\nUse when context is relevant but conversation is getting long\nExample: \"Redesign the entire user management system\"\nLong conversation with many iterations...\n/compact\nClaude summarizes key decisions and current state\nAsk: \"Now add admin permissions to this system\"\nContinues with compressed context\n\nWhen to use each:\n/clear: Switching projects, unrelated tasks, after major milestones\n/compact: Long sessions, context getting full, but need to keep continuity\n\nPro tip: Watch the context indicator (bottom-right corner) and clear proactively at natural stopping points\n\n\n6. RESUME CONVERSATIONS WITH claude --resume\n\nWhat it does:\nContinue exactly where you left off in your previous Claude session.\n\nWays to use:\nResume most recent conversation:\nclaude --resume\n\nResume specific conversation (if you have multiple):\nclaude --resume --select\nShows list of recent conversations to choose from\n\nResume without interaction:\nclaude --resume --print\nContinues previous conversation in automatic mode\n\nWhat stays the same:\n- Complete message history\n- Context from previous session\n- Tool usage and results\n- Project state and memory\n\nExample workflow:\nDay 1: Start complex project change\nAsk: \"Redesign the entire login system to use OAuth2\"\nWork for 2 hours, then close terminal\n\nDay 2: Continue exactly where you left off\nclaude --resume\nAll previous context comes back\nAsk: \"Continue with the OAuth2 setup where we left off\"\n\n\n================================================================================\nCORE WORKFLOW FEATURES\n================================================================================\n\n7. INSTANT MEMORY ADDITION WITH #\n\nWhat it does:\nQuickly add context or preferences to your project memory without editing files manually.\n\nHow to use:\nAsk: \"Create a login form # always use Zod for validation\"\nAsk: \"Build the dashboard # prefer MUI components over custom CSS\"\nAsk: \"Add error handling # use our standard error boundary pattern\"\n\nWhat happens: Claude automatically saves these preferences to the right memory file (CLAUDE.md, project memory, or user memory) and uses them in future tasks.\n\nExample workflow:\nAsk: \"Style this button # our brand uses #3B82F6 as primary blue\"\nClaude saves this color preference and uses it in all future styling tasks\n\n\n8. QUEUE COMMANDS WHILE CLAUDE WORKS\n\nWhat it does:\nAdd multiple tasks to a waiting list while Claude is actively working on your current request.\n\nHow to use:\nAsk: \"Redesign the user login system\"\nWhile Claude is working, you can add:\nAsk: \"Also add comprehensive unit tests\"\nAsk: \"And update the documentation\"\nAsk: \"Plus add TypeScript types everywhere\"\n\nSmart behavior: Claude intelligently groups these commands and runs them when appropriate, asking for feedback only when necessary.\n\nExample workflow:\nAsk: \"Build a shopping cart component\"\nQueue while processing:\nAsk: \"Add cart saving to localStorage\"\nAsk: \"Include quantity controls\"\nAsk: \"Add price calculations\"\nAsk: \"Style it with Tailwind\"\nClaude will handle all these systematically\n\n\n9. COMMIT WORKFLOW AS CHECKPOINTS\n\nWhat it does:\nUse git commits as natural save points in your development workflow.\n\nBest practice pattern:\nComplete a logical unit of work:\nAsk: \"Add user login functionality with validation\"\n\nAlways commit when task is complete:\nAsk: \"Commit these changes with a descriptive message\"\n\nThis creates a save point you can return to:\nAsk: \"Now add password reset functionality\"\n\nIf something goes wrong:\nAsk: \"Go back to the last commit and try a different approach\"\n\nAdvanced save point strategy:\n1. Feature branch for experiments\nAsk: \"Create a feature branch called 'experiment-auth-redesign'\"\n\n2. Small, frequent commits\nAsk: \"Commit after each small change so we can rollback easily\"\n\n3. Use commits for testing different approaches  \nAsk: \"Try approach A, commit it, then try approach B in next commit\"\n\n\n================================================================================\nMODEL AND PERFORMANCE FEATURES\n================================================================================\n\n10. SWITCH MODELS WITH /model\n\nWhat it does:\nChange Claude models mid-conversation based on task complexity.\n\nUsage patterns:\nQuick switch to specific model:\n/model haiku     Fast, cheap for simple tasks\n/model sonnet    Balanced for daily development  \n/model opus      Powerful for complex architecture\n\nOr just /model to see available options and switch interactively\n\nSmart model usage:\nStart with Sonnet for feature development:\nAsk: \"Build user dashboard with charts\"\n\nSwitch to Opus for complex changes:\n/model opus\nAsk: \"Redesign this entire login system to use OAuth2\"\n\nSwitch to Haiku for quick fixes:\n/model haiku  \nAsk: \"Fix indentation and add missing semicolons\"\n\nCost optimization:\nHaiku: $0.25/MTok - Use for formatting, simple fixes\nSonnet: $3/MTok - Daily development workhorse\nOpus: $15/MTok - Complex architecture, code reviews\n\n\n11. EXTENDED THINKING WITH THINK KEYWORDS\n\nWhat it does:\nActivate Claude's extended reasoning mode for complex problems.\n\nKeywords that trigger extended thinking:\nAsk: \"think hard about the best architecture for this microservices system\"\nAsk: \"think deeply about security implications of this API design\"  \nAsk: \"ultrathink the performance bottlenecks in this database schema\"\nAsk: \"think harder about edge cases in this login flow\"\n\nWhen extended thinking appears:\n- Complex architectural decisions\n- Security analysis\n- Performance optimization\n- Edge case identification\n- Multi-step problem solving\n\nExample usage:\nAsk: \"think hard about moving our monolith to microservices\"\n\nClaude shows extended thinking:\n\"Let me think through this systematically...\n1. Current coupling between components\n2. Data consistency requirements  \n3. Network latency implications\n4. Deployment complexity...\"\n\nThen provides comprehensive analysis\n\n\n================================================================================\nADVANCED FEATURES\n================================================================================\n\n12. CONTROL AUTOMATION WITH SETTINGS\n\nWhat it does:\nConfigure Claude's behavior for plan mode and auto-accept edit mode.\n\nConfiguration file: .claude/settings.json\n{\n  \"planMode\": true,\n  \"autoAcceptEdits\": false,\n  \"defaultModel\": \"sonnet\",\n  \"permissionDefaults\": {\n    \"read\": true,\n    \"write\": \"ask\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlan Mode: Claude creates a detailed plan before executing\nWith plan mode enabled:\nAsk: \"Build a REST API for user management\"\nClaude shows: \"Here's my plan: 1. Create routes 2. Add validation 3. Add auth...\"\nYou approve, then Claude executes the plan step by step\n\nAuto-Accept Edit Mode: Automatically approve file changes\nDangerous but fast - Claude edits files without asking\nGood for: Formatting, linting fixes, batch updates\nBad for: Complex logic changes, new features\n\n\n13. DIRECT IMAGE PASTING WITH CTRL+V\n\nWhat it does:\nPaste images directly into Claude terminal for visual development.\n\nKey difference: Use Ctrl+V (not Cmd+V on Mac)\n\nWorkflow examples:\nDesign implementation:\n1. Take screenshot of design mockup\n2. Ctrl+V in Claude terminal\nAsk: \"Build this design in React with Tailwind CSS\"\n\nBug reporting with visuals:\n1. Screenshot of broken UI\n2. Ctrl+V in Claude\nAsk: \"This button styling is broken on mobile. Fix the responsive design.\"\n\nVisual iteration:\nAsk: \"Take a screenshot of the current implementation\"\nClaude uses tools to screenshot\nAsk: \"Compare with the original design and fix differences\"\n\nPro tip: Use Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4 on Mac to screenshot directly to clipboard, then Ctrl+V to paste.\n\n\n14. CUSTOM COMMANDS WITH /command\n\nWhat it does:\nCreate reusable command templates for common workflows.\n\nCreating custom commands:\nCreate commands directory:\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\n\nCreate custom command file:\nFile: .claude/commands/deploy.md\n\nExample custom commands:\n\nFile: .claude/commands/deploy.md\nDeploy application following our checklist:\n1.

SUB AGENTS\n\nWhat it does:\nClaude can create specialized sub-agents to handle specific subtasks while maintaining the main conversation flow.\n\nHow it works:\nClaude automatically creates sub-agents when tasks require specialized focus or parallel processing. You'll see indicators like \"Task(Research authentication patterns)...\" in the output.\n\nManual sub-agent creation:\nAsk: \"Use subagents to research OAuth2 best practices while I continue working on the UI\"\nAsk: \"Create a subagent to analyze our current security setup\"\nAsk: \"Make a specialized subagent for database optimization tasks\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Parallel processing of complex tasks\n- Specialized expertise for different domains\n- Context isolation for focused work\n- Maintains main conversation flow\n\nExample workflow:\nAsk: \"Build a complete online store system\"\nClaude creates subagents:\n- Task(Research payment gateway integration)\n- Task(Design database schema)\n- Task(Plan frontend architecture)\n- Task(Security requirements analysis)\n\nEach subagent works independently while reporting back to main Claude instance.\n\n\n18. SUB AGENT CHAINING\n\nWhat it does:\nCreate chains of sub-agents where the output of one becomes input for the next, creating sophisticated workflows.\n\nHow to use:\nAsk: \"Create a subagent chain: 1) Research competitor APIs, 2) Design our API based on findings, 3) Generate implementation plan, 4) Create code structure\"\n\nAdvanced chaining example:\nAsk: \"Chain subagents for user authentication: Research → Design → Implement → Test → Document\"\n\nEach agent in the chain:\n1. Agent 1: Research authentication methods and security best practices\n2. Agent 2: Design authentication flow based on research\n3. Agent 3: Implement the authentication system\n4. Agent 4: Create comprehensive tests\n5. Agent 5: Generate documentation\n\nSequential execution:\nAsk: \"Create a deployment chain: code review → security scan → build → test → staging deploy → production deploy\"\n\nConditional chaining:\nAsk: \"Chain subagents but only proceed to next step if previous succeeds: lint → test → build → deploy\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Complex workflows broken into manageable steps\n- Quality gates between stages\n- Rollback capability at each stage\n- Parallel branches when needed\n\n\n19. BACKGROUND BASH AGENTS\n\nWhat it does:\nRun specialized agents that monitor system processes, logs, or perform continuous tasks in the background while you work on other things.\n\nSetting up background agents:\nAsk: \"Start a background agent to monitor our application logs and alert me about errors\"\nAsk: \"Run a background bash agent to watch file changes and auto-restart the server\"\nAsk: \"Create a monitoring agent that tracks system performance during our load test\"\n\nBackground monitoring examples:\nLog monitoring agent:\nAsk: \"Background agent: tail -f /var/log/app.log and notify me of any ERROR or CRITICAL level messages\"\n\nPerformance monitoring agent:\nAsk: \"Start background monitoring of CPU and memory usage during this deployment\"\n\nSecurity monitoring agent:\nAsk: \"Background agent: monitor failed login attempts and alert if threshold exceeded\"\n\nDevelopment workflow agents:\nAuto-testing agent:\nAsk: \"Background agent: watch src/ directory and run relevant tests when files change\"\n\nCode quality agent:\nAsk: \"Background agent: run ESLint on any modified files and report issues\"\n\nDeployment monitoring agent:\nAsk: \"Background agent: monitor staging environment health during deployment\"\n\nManaging background agents:\nAsk: \"List all active background agents\"\nAsk: \"Stop the log monitoring agent\"\nAsk: \"Show output from performance monitoring agent\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Continuous monitoring without manual oversight\n- Early detection of issues\n- Automated quality checks\n- Hands-free operational tasks\n\n\n20. PARALLEL AGENTS\n\nWhat it does:\nRun multiple Claude instances simultaneously, each working on different aspects of the same project or different projects entirely.\n\nSetting up parallel agents:\nTerminal approach:\n# Terminal 1\nclaude\nAsk: \"Work on frontend user interface\"\n\n# Terminal 2  \nclaude\nAsk: \"Develop backend API endpoints\"\n\n# Terminal 3\nclaude\nAsk: \"Create comprehensive test suite\"\n\n# Terminal 4\nclaude\nAsk: \"Handle DevOps and deployment setup\"\n\nCoordinated parallel work:\nAsk: \"Start parallel agents: one for React frontend, one for Node.js backend, one for database design, one for testing\"\n\nGit worktree parallel development:\nAsk: \"Create git worktrees for parallel development: main feature in worktree1, experimental approach in worktree2\"\n\nAdvanced parallel patterns:\nA/B testing parallel agents:\nAsk: \"Run two parallel agents: one implementing approach A, another implementing approach B for the same feature\"\n\nCompetitive development:\nAsk: \"Start parallel agents working on the same problem with different approaches, then compare results\"\n\nSpecialized team simulation:\nAsk: \"Parallel agents: Frontend specialist, Backend specialist, DevOps specialist, QA specialist - simulate a full development team\"\n\nCross-project parallel work:\n# Project 1\nclaude\nAsk: \"Redesign authentication system\"\n\n# Project 2\nclaude  \nAsk: \"Build new user dashboard\"\n\n# Project 3\nclaude\nAsk: \"Optimize database queries\"\n\nCoordination strategies:\nShared context updates:\nAsk: \"Update all parallel agents with this new requirement: implement GDPR compliance\"\n\nProgress synchronization:\nAsk: \"Check progress of all parallel agents and create unified status report\"\n\nIntegration planning:\nAsk: \"Coordinate parallel agents to merge their work at the next milestone\"\n\nBenefits:\n- Massive productivity multiplication\n- Different approaches to same problem\n- Parallel exploration of alternatives\n- Simulated team development\n- Faster iteration cycles\n\n\n================================================================================\nPOWER USER COMPLETE WORKFLOW\n================================================================================\n\nComplete Advanced Workflow:\n\n1. Setup project foundation:\nclaude\n@CLAUDE.md @package.json @src/\n/dir ../reference-project\n\n2. Configure for optimal performance:\n/model opus\nAsk: \"think hard about the architecture for this complex system\"\n\n3. Start parallel development:\nAsk: \"Create parallel agents: frontend team, backend team, testing team, devops team\"\n\n4. Setup background monitoring:\nAsk: \"Start background agents for log monitoring, performance tracking, and security scanning\"\n\n5. Use subagent chains for complex features:\nAsk: \"Create subagent chain for user authentication: research → design → implement → test → document\"\n\n6. Queue coordinated tasks:\nAsk: \"Coordinate all agents to implement OAuth2 integration\"\nAsk: \"All agents should follow our security standards # use industry best practices\"\nAsk: \"Update progress every 30 minutes # checkpoint pattern\"\n\n7. Manage context and checkpoints:\n/compact when needed\nAsk: \"Commit each agent's work as separate feature branches\"\n\n8. Deploy with automation:\n/deploy\nAsk: \"Coordinate deployment across all parallel workstreams\"\n\n9. Monitor and iterate:\nAsk: \"Background agents continue monitoring while we iterate on next features\"\n\nThis advanced orchestration turns Claude Code into a complete development team, handling multiple aspects of software development simultaneously while maintaining coordination and quality standards.\n\n================================================================================\nEND OF GUIDE\n================================================================================","numLines":756,"startLine":1,"totalLines":756}}}
