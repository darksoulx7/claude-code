Home Branch is the main employee branch. The punch-in branches are the branches where punch-in is allowed from\n     3→2. Each punch-in branch will have maximum 1500 fingerprints (we can cap it to 750 employees for now)\n     4→3. Home branch is where the employee will be visible, home branch may not necessarily be a punch-in branch\n     5→4. In payroll and other reports, we consider date of changing the master branch. We can do this either by creating a history of master branch in another table or putting master branch in journal entry itself.\n     6→5. We need to allow schedule transfer just like schedule termination. For example, I can schedule an employee to move from one branch to another on a future date. In payroll and other reports, we need to show only presence or absence in that branch\n     7→6. There will be a configuration to do either branch-wise payroll or HO-wise payroll. If someone wants to switch from branch-wise to central, all branches need to be frozen to a common date only then you can switch. Switching from HO to branchwise should be easy to do since all branches are by default frozen to the same date.\n     8→7. employee only can assinged to one home branch at a time, but can have multiple punch-in branches.\n     9→8 employee can be assgined to shift in home branch.\n    10→   \n    11→Q&A:\n    12→- Q1.1: Can an employee have NO home branch temporarily, or must every employee always have exactly one home branch?\n    13→  each employee must always have exactly one home branch.\n    14→- Q1.2: If an employee's home branch is different from punch-in branch, where should they appear in employee lists/reports?\n    15→  They should appear in both home branch\n    16→- Q1.3: Can the home branch be a branch where punch-in is NOT allowed?\n    17→  yes, the home branch must be a branch where punch-in is allowed.\n    18→- Q1.4: Who has the authority to change an employee's home branch? (HR only, Branch Manager, Admin?)\n    19→  superadmin\n    20→- Q1.5: Should there be approval workflow for home branch changes?\n    21→  no approval workflow is needed for home branch changes.\n    22→\n    23→Punch-In Branch Rules\n    24→\n    25→- Q2.1: Can an employee punch-in from multiple branches on the same day?\n    26→  yes\n    27→- Q2.2: What happens if an employee punches in from a branch they're not assigned to?\n    28→  that scenario is already handled in this project, that punch will not map to the employee's home branch and will be logged as an exception.\n    29→- Q2.3: Should there be time-based restrictions (e.g., can't punch from Branch A after 6 PM)?\n    30→  no, there is some logic like theare shift timings are there, to idenify the shift and puhch will map on that shift not on the branch.\n    31→- Q2.4: If punch-in fails due to capacity, should there be a queue system or immediate rejection?\n    32→  nope\n    33→- Q2.5: Can temporary punch-in permissions be granted for specific dates?\n    34→  no\n    35→\n    36→Fingerprint Capacity Management\n    37→\n    38→- Q3.1: What happens when a branch reaches its 750 employee limit?\n    39→  When a branch reaches its 750 employee limit, no new employees can be assigned to that branch until capacity is freed up.\n    40→- Q3.2: Should inactive/terminated employees be automatically removed from fingerprint capacity?\n    41→  Yes, inactive or terminated employees should be automatically removed from fingerprint capacity to free up space for new employees.\n    42→- Q3.3: Can capacity be temporarily increased for specific periods?\n    43→  No, capacity cannot be temporarily increased; it is fixed at 750 employees per branch.\n    44→- Q3.4: Who manages fingerprint capacity allocation per branch?\n    45→  The superadmin manages fingerprint capacity allocation per branch.\n    46→- Q3.5: What's the priority order if multiple employees need fingerprint slots?\n    47→  The priority order for fingerprint slots is based on the employee's home branch assignment and their active status.

Home Branch is the main employee branch. The punch-in branches are the branches where punch-in is allowed from\n2. Each punch-in branch will have maximum 1500 fingerprints (we can cap it to 750 employees for now)\n3. Home branch is where the employee will be visible, home branch may not necessarily be a punch-in branch\n4. In payroll and other reports, we consider date of changing the master branch. We can do this either by creating a history of master branch in another table or putting master branch in journal entry itself.\n5. We need to allow schedule transfer just like schedule termination. For example, I can schedule an employee to move from one branch to another on a future date. In payroll and other reports, we need to show only presence or absence in that branch\n6. There will be a configuration to do either branch-wise payroll or HO-wise payroll. If someone wants to switch from branch-wise to central, all branches need to be frozen to a common date only then you can switch. Switching from HO to branchwise should be easy to do since all branches are by default frozen to the same date.\n7. employee only can assinged to one home branch at a time, but can have multiple punch-in branches.\n8 employee can be assgined to shift in home branch.\n   \nQ&A:\n- Q1.1: Can an employee have NO home branch temporarily, or must every employee always have exactly one home branch?\n  each employee must always have exactly one home branch.\n- Q1.2: If an employee's home branch is different from punch-in branch, where should they appear in employee lists/reports?\n  They should appear in both home branch\n- Q1.3: Can the home branch be a branch where punch-in is NOT allowed?\n  yes, the home branch must be a branch where punch-in is allowed.\n- Q1.4: Who has the authority to change an employee's home branch? (HR only, Branch Manager, Admin?)\n  superadmin\n- Q1.5: Should there be approval workflow for home branch changes?\n  no approval workflow is needed for home branch changes.\n\nPunch-In Branch Rules\n\n- Q2.1: Can an employee punch-in from multiple branches on the same day?\n  yes\n- Q2.2: What happens if an employee punches in from a branch they're not assigned to?\n  that scenario is already handled in this project, that punch will not map to the employee's home branch and will be logged as an exception.\n- Q2.3: Should there be time-based restrictions (e.g., can't punch from Branch A after 6 PM)?\n  no, there is some logic like theare shift timings are there, to idenify the shift and puhch will map on that shift not on the branch.\n- Q2.4: If punch-in fails due to capacity, should there be a queue system or immediate rejection?\n  nope\n- Q2.5: Can temporary punch-in permissions be granted for specific dates?\n  no\n\nFingerprint Capacity Management\n\n- Q3.1: What happens when a branch reaches its 750 employee limit?\n  When a branch reaches its 750 employee limit, no new employees can be assigned to that branch until capacity is freed up.\n- Q3.2: Should inactive/terminated employees be automatically removed from fingerprint capacity?\n  Yes, inactive or terminated employees should be automatically removed from fingerprint capacity to free up space for new employees.\n- Q3.3: Can capacity be temporarily increased for specific periods?\n  No, capacity cannot be temporarily increased; it is fixed at 750 employees per branch.\n- Q3.4: Who manages fingerprint capacity allocation per branch?\n  The superadmin manages fingerprint capacity allocation per branch.\n- Q3.5: What's the priority order if multiple employees need fingerprint slots?\n  The priority order for fingerprint slots is based on the employee's home branch assignment and their active status. New employees will be prioritized over inactive or terminated employees.\n\n2. Data Migration & Existing Data Handling\n\nCurrent Employee Data\n\n- Q4.1: For existing employees, how do we determine their initial home branch?\n  we will se last 10 days of attendance data to determine the initial home branch for existing employees.\n- Q4.2: Should all existing employees default to their current organization_id as home branch?\n  Yes, all existing employees should default to their current organization_id as their home branch. but for multiple branches, we will set the home branch based on the last 10 days of attendance data.\n- Q4.3: What happens to employees who are currently in multiple branches?\n  Employees currently in multiple branches should have their home branch set based on the last 10 days of attendance data, and they will retain their punch-in access to all branches.\n- Q4.4: Are there any employees who should NOT have a home branch initially?\n  No without that punch will not map to any branch, so every existing employee has a branch not a home branch yet.\n- Q4.5: How do we handle employees with invalid/missing branch associations?\n  if we found any employees with invalid or missing branch associations, we will set their home branch to the default organization_id and notify the admin for review.\n\nHistorical Data\n\n- Q5.1: Should we backfill historical attendance data with branch information?\n  No\n- Q5.2: How far back should we maintain master branch change history?\n  suppose feature is implemnted in July 2025 then we will maintain master branch change history from July 2025 onwards.\n- Q5.3: What happens to existing payroll data - should it be re-categorized by branch?\n  Existing payroll data should not be re-categorized by branch; it will remain as is, but future payroll calculations will consider the home branch.\n- Q5.4: Are there any reports that need historical master branch data?\n  Yes, reports that analyze employee movement across branches or historical attendance patterns may require access to master branch data.\n\n3. Schedule Transfer Functionality\n\nTransfer Rules\n\n- Q6.1: Can multiple transfers be scheduled for the same employee?\n  yes but from date and to date should not overlap.\n- Q6.2: What's the minimum notice period required for a transfer?\n  there is no such thing as minimum notice period required for a transfer.\n- Q6.3: Can transfers be cancelled? If yes, until when?\n  Yes, transfers can be cancelled until the transfer date is reached.\n- Q6.4: Should there be automatic notifications for upcoming transfers?\n  Yes, automatic notifications should be sent to both the employee and the target branch manager about upcoming transfers.\n- Q6.5: What happens if the target branch is at capacity during transfer?\n  warning message will be shown to the user that target branch is at capacity, and transfer will not be allowed until capacity is freed up.\n\nTransfer Types\n\n- Q7.1: Can we transfer just home branch, just punch-in access, or both?\n  only home branch can be transferred, punch-in access will remain the same. punch in branch user can change at any time.\n- Q7.2: Should fingerprint data be automatically migrated during transfer?\n  No, fingerprint data should not be automatically migrated during transfer; the employee will retain their existing fingerprint data.\n- Q7.3: Do employee permissions/roles change with branch transfer?\n  No, employee permissions and roles should remain unchanged during branch transfer.\n- Q7.4: Are there any department/designation restrictions for transfers?\n  no\n\nPayroll Impact\n\n- Q8.1: How should payroll be calculated during the transfer month?\n  N/A\n- Q8.2: Which branch should pay the employee during transition period?\n  N/A\n- Q8.3: Are there any branch-specific salary components that need adjustment?\n  N/A\n- Q8.4: Should pro-rated calculations be automatic or manual?\n  N/A\n\n4. Branch-wise vs HO-wise Payroll Configuration\n\nProcessing Mode Rules\n\n- Q9.1: Can different departments have different payroll processing modes?\n  No\n- Q9.2: What constitutes \"frozen to a common date\" for branch-wise to central switching?\n  mean if want to switch from branch-wise payroll processing to central processing, all branches must be frozen to a common date, meaning no payroll changes can be made after that date until the switch is complete.\n- Q9.3: Who has authority to switch payroll processing modes?\n  there is a specific right called 'payroll' if any user has that right then only they can switch payroll processing modes.\n- Q9.4: Should there be a testing/preview mode before actual switch?\n  no\n- Q9.5: What happens to pending payroll processes during mode switch?\n  no such thing like payroll processes\n\nFreeze Management\n\n- Q10.1: Can individual branches be frozen while others remain active?\n  yes\n- Q10.2: What operations are restricted when a branch is frozen?\n  branch will not be frozen,\n- Q10.3: How should emergency payroll changes be handled during freeze?\n  N/A\n- Q10.4: Are there any automatic freeze triggers (end of month, etc.)?\n- N/A\n\n5.
